%EXPLANATION OF SCRIPTS%

%% 1. epsMainScript.m 
% EXPLANATION: Provides the user with the calculation of the effective 
% permittivity for the composite discussed in "Ballistic Metamaterials"
% (https://doi.org/10.1364/OPTICA.402891). Specifically, when run, the code
% provides the in-plane and perpendicular components of the composite dielectric
% tensor for HMM3 (4um composite with individual InGaAs/AlInAs of 9.5nm).
% Run this script to illustrate the dielectric tensor components used in
% R/T/A calculations. 

%% 2. tmmMainScript.m
% EXPLANATION: Provides user with absorption spectrum of HMM3 from the
% manuscript (see above). The resulting plot displays the absorption as a
% surface plot as a function of the incident angle (y-axis) and wavelength 
%(x-axis). The script also saves the reflection coefficient and
%transmission coefficient.
